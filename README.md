## Installation
### Requirements
- Webserver (no matter which)
- Mysql/MariaDB (else you have to rewrite the "php->mysqli-query" connects)
- PHP7
- Just a lil bit knowledge in what you are doing, but seriously it's plain html/php... you can't do much wrong

### Installation
1. Create database and database-user with grant on that database (name it yourway)
3. Push the db_structure.sql file into your database. All required tables will be created
4. Configure your webserver your way and set "index.php" as index page and the servername to your domain from which the site will be accessable
5. Copy all files (except .sql file) into your web-root directory
6. Modify the db.inc.php file (exchange database credentials with yours)
7. Edit index.php and change titles/names according your needs
8. Edit generate... and validate... files and change the "echo" outputs to your needs 
8. Ofc you can exchange the favicon
9. Create user in the "user" table with name, email and if needed sms-number
10. Currenty there are two validations needed for a strike - If you want more validations for a strike you just have to edit the validate... files and add a new column to the "pending_strike..." tables
10. Open a beer and try it out!
