## Installation
### Requirements
- Webserver (no matter which)
- Mysql/MariaDB (else you have to rewrite the "php->mysqli-query" connects)
- PHP7
- Just a lil bit knowledge in what you are doing, but seriously it's plain html/php... you can't do much wrong

### Installation
1. Create database and database-user with grant on that database (name it yourway)
2. Modify the db_structure file (exchange database-name with yours)
3. Push the file into your database. All required tables will be created
4. Configure your webserver your way and set "index.php" as index page
5. Copy all files (except .sql file) into your web-root directory
6. Modify the db.inc.php file (exchange database credentials with yours)
7. Look through all files and change hostnames, links, titles etc. to your needs (shouldn't be that much - will be less in future, variables ftw)
8. Create user in the "user" table with name, email and if needed sms-number
9. Open a beer and try it out!
